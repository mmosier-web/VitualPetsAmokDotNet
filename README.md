When the game starts and asks to enter "Y" or "N" if you enter "Y" the game will start; if you enter "N" the game will end.
The game will welcome you after pressing "Y" and ask you what your pet's name is.
Then it will ask you what species it is "Enter Species".
Next it will open the main menu and all the information to interact is here.
If your animals's health falls to "0" it will die. (Be responsible)
